                The Drosophila is a microscopic video surveillance system inspired my nature. It is intended to utilize the power of modern surveillance for live cell imaging applications. It is a compact, high performance, affordable system that is made possible by proprietary design and engineering. ​

                Our technology is a modular, inexpensive, climate proof surveillance system that can be placed inside of a standard incubator for live cell imaging applications. Each system contains multiple imaging modules, where each module contains an independently controlled digital video microscope. The modules are arranged on a universal platform which collects data from the modules, and delivers the data remotely to cloud servers, so that videos can be remotely viewed and analyzed anywhere, and anytime. ​
