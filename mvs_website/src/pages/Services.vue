                The Microscopic Video Surveillance (MVS) project promotes the use of surveillance technology for live cell imaging microscopy. This technology enables investigators to record video footage of multiple live cell cultures simultaneously, in a standard incubator over extended periods of time. Our MVS system features up to six inverted light microscope cameras (200x total magnification) with remote stage movement control and focusing manipulations (x, y, and z plane), as well as surveillance capabilities from a remote location. Real-time recordings are accessible from a Mac/PC or handheld device. Video editing and data generation services are available for an additional cost.
