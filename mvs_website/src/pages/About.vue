                In modern biomedical research there is a high demand for real-time video microscopy, yet an access bottleneck exists due to a combination of the large size, complexity and high cost of existing commercial systems. Our goal is to make live cell imaging accessible for the masses. In order to do this, we have established online services to connect investigators with our emerging live cell imaging technologies and facilities. In addition, we are currently developing an easy to use, affordable, high performance commercial system that will put the power of live cell imaging surveillance within reach for the modern-day investigator.
